With plenty of advice from an indisputable expert in the field, this title is sure to be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to get more out of their code.As a veteran developer at Sun, the author shares his considerable insight into the design choices made over the years in Suns own Java libraries (which the author acknowledges havent always been perfect). Based on his experience working with Suns best minds, the author provides a compilation of 57 tips for better Java code organized by category. Many of these ideas will let you write more robust classes that better cooperate with built-in Java APIs. Many of the tips make use of software patterns and demonstrate an up-to-the-minute sense of what works best in todays design. Each tip is clearly introduced and explained with code snippets used to demonstrate each programming principle.Early sections on creating and destroying objects show you ways to make better use of resources, including how to avoid duplicate objects. Next comes an absolutely indispensable guide to implementing "required" methods for custom classes. This material will help you write new classes that cooperate with old ones (with advice on implementing essential requirements like the equals() and hashCode() methods).The author has a lot to say about class design, whether using inheritance or composition. Tips on designing methods show you how to create understandable, maintainable, and robust classes that can be easily reused by others on your team. Sections on mapping C code (like structures, unions, and enumerated types) onto Java will help C programmers bring their existing skills to Suns new language. Later sections delve into some general programming tips, like using exceptions effectively. The book closes with advice on using threads and synchronization techniques, plus some worthwhile advice on object serialization.Whatever your level of Java knowledge, this title can make you a more effective programmer. Wisely written, yet never pompous or doctrinaire, the author has succeeded in packaging some really valuable nuggets of advice into a concise and very accessible guidebook that arguably deserves a place on most any developers bookshelf. Richard Dragan Topics covered: Best practices and tips for Java Creating and destroying objects (static factory methods, singletons, avoiding duplicate objects and finalizers) Required methods for custom classes (overriding equals(), hashCode(), toString(), clone(), and compareTo() properly) Hints for class and interface design (minimizing class and member accessibility, immutability, composition versus inheritance, interfaces versus abstract classes, preventing subclassing, static versus nonstatic classes) C constructs in Java (structures, unions, enumerated types, and function pointers in Java) Tips for designing methods (parameter validation, defensive copies, method signatures, method overloading, zero-length arrays, hints for Javadoc comments) General programming advice (local variable scope, using Java API libraries, avoiding float and double for exact comparisons, when to avoid strings, string concatenation, interfaces and reflection, avoid native methods, optimizing hints, naming conventions) Programming with exceptions (checked versus run-time exceptions, standard exceptions, documenting exceptions, failure-capture information, failure atomicity) Threading and multitasking (synchronization and scheduling hints, thread safety, avoiding thread groups) Serialization (when to implement Serializable, the readObject(), and readResolve() methods)', 2),

This approach is sure to appeal to programmers and system administrators who have urgent problems and a preference for learning by semi-guided experimentation. First off, Learning Python shows the relationships among Python scripts and their interpreter (in a mostly platform-neutral way). Then, the authors address the mechanics of the language itself, providing illustrations of how Python conceives of numbers, strings, and other objects as well as the operators you use to work with them. Dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other data structures specific to Python receive plenty of attention including complete examples. Authors Mark Lutz and David Ascher build on that fundamental information in their discussions of functions and modules, which evolve into coverage of namespaces, classes, and the object-oriented aspects of Python programming. Theres also information on creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Python applications with Tkinter. In addition to its careful expository prose, Learning Python includes exercises that both test your Python skills and help reveal more elusive truths about the language.', 2),

You know Java well enough to write standalone applets and applications, even multithreaded ones, but you know next to nothing about the languages networking capabilities. And guess whatyour next job is to write a network-centric Java program. Java Network Programming serves as an excellent introduction to network communications generally and in Java. The book opens with information on network architectures and protocols and the security restrictions placed on applets. Quickly, the author gets to the meat of networked Java with a complete elucidation of the InetAddress class, the URL-related classes, applet-specific networking methods, and sockets. The author also covers packets, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and servlets. The one serious shortcoming of this book is that it does not include a companion disk, which is the case with most OReilly books. Youll have to visit the publishers FTP site for the code if you dislike typing the examples manually. On the whole, though, this is an excellent tutorial that will guide you through the world of Java networking as smoothly as possible.', 2),

  ('Java Message Service', 24.59, 'Paperback', 'English', '0596000685', '2000-11-14', 'David Chappell', 'O\'Reilly Media', 238, 19, 'The Java Message Service (JMS) provides a way for the components of a distributed application to talk asynchronously, or for welding together legacy enterprise systems. Think of it as application-to-application e-mail. Unlike COM, JMS uses one or more JMS servers to handle the messages on a store-and-forward basis, so that the loss of one or more components doesnt bring the whole distributed application to a halt. JMS consists of a set of messaging APIs that enable two types of messaging, publish-and-subscribe (one-to-many) and point-to-point (one-to-one). The highly lucid explanation of the ways in which these work makes the technical content a lot more approachable. In practice, however, Java Message Service is still a book for Java programmers who have some business programming experience. You need the background. After a simple JMS demonstration in which you create a chat application using both messaging types, the authors dissect JMS message structures, explore both types in detail, and then move on to real-world considerations. These include reliability, security, deployment, and a rundown of various JMS server providers. The appendices list and describe the JMS API, and provide message reference material. Considering the complexity and reach of the subject matter, Java Message Service does a great job of covering both theory and practice in a surprisingly efficient manner. Its easy to see why JMS has become so popular so quickly.', 2),
